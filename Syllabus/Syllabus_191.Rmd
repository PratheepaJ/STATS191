## Prerequisites
An introductory statistics course, such as
- [STATS 60](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20182019&q=STATS+60%3A+Introduction+to+Statistical+Methods%3A+Precalculus+&collapse=) or [STATS 110](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20182019&q=STATS+110%3A+Statistical+Methods+in+Engineering+and+the+Physical+Sciences&collapse=) or [STATS 141](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=stats141&collapse=).

##  Course Overview

Statistical tools for modern data analysis. Topics include regression and prediction, elements of the analysis of variance, bootstrap, and cross-validation. Emphasis is on conceptual rather than theoretical understanding. Student assignments require use of the software package [R](http://cran.r-project.org). 

## Expected outcomes

By the end of the course, students should be able to: 

- Enter tabular data using [R](http://cran.r-project.org).
- Plot data using [R](http://cran.r-project.org), to help in exploratory data analysis.
- Formulate regression models for the data, while understanding some of the limitations and assumptions implicit in using these models.
- Fit models using [R](http://cran.r-project.org) and interpret the output.
- Test for associations in a given model.
- Use diagnostic plots and tests to assess the adequacy of a particular model.
- Find confidence intervals for the effects of different explanatory variables in the model.
- Use some basic model selection procedures, as found in [R](http://cran.r-project.org), to find a *best* model in a class of models.
- Fit simple ANOVA models in [R](http://cran.r-project.org), treating them as special cases of multiple regression models.
- Fit simple logistic and Poisson regression models.

##  Textbook
- Required:
  - **(CH)** [Regression Analysis by Example](http://www1.aucegypt.edu/faculty/hadi/RABE5).
    - Authors: Samprit Chatterjee, Ali S. Hadi
    - Edition: $5^{th}$ Edition
    - Print ISBN:978-0-470-90584-05 
    
##  Software
- In this course, we will use R for computing and R Markdown for producing lecture slides, solutions for homework assignments. R Markdown is highly recommended to write the solutions for homework assignments. Install the following software:
    - R (required): [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
    - R Studio is highly recommended for syntax highlighting, package management, document generation, and more: [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/).
        - The newest version of R Studio is highly recommended.
    - Latex, which will enable you to create PDFs directly from the R Markdown in RStudio.
        - Mac users should download macTeX [http://www.tug.org/mactex/downloading.html](http://www.tug.org/mactex/downloading.html) from Safari (not Chrome).
        - Windows users should install MiKTeX [https://miktex.org/download](https://miktex.org/download).

##  Evaluation

The final letter grade for this course will be determined by each method of assessment weighted as follows:

- 7 weekly homework assignments  (55%)
- Midterm examination (15%, Wednesday, 10/23/2019)
- Final examination (30%, according to Stanford calendar: Wednesday, 12/11/2019 @ 3:30 PM, location TBD)

##  Policies

- Class Participation
    - This includes in-class participation and [Canvas Discussion](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/108253/discussion_topics).
    - When homework involves simulations and data analysis, you will use R statistical computing software. Please post your R or R Markdown questions to Canvas Discussion.
    - Instructor or TA or other students in your class can answer your questions.
    - When asking questions about code, be specific (copy and paste the exact error, relevant code, and describe what you are attempting to do). We will not answer questions that are too similar to the problem sets or that would be better answered in office hours with a whiteboard. Needless to say, you should conduct yourself in a courteous and respectful manner on Canvas Discussion.

    
- Weekly homework assignments
    - Homework assignment will be assigned every Friday on [Canvas Assignments](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/108253/assignments).
    - Homework assignment will be due every Friday. 
        - Prepare your completed homework assignment in PDF format and submit a copy to your folder on Canvas.
    - Use [R markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) in R Studio and render it to PDF
        - See the following [link](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/) for further outline of using [R markdown for reporting](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/rmarkdown.Rmd).
    - Each question in the homework assignment will be graded as follows: $scale \in \left\lbrace 0,1,2\right\rbrace$ 
        - 2: submitted on time and more or less correct answer
        - 1: submitted on time and partially correct answer
        - 0: submitted with a completely incorrect answer or late submission (any day after the due date for more than one homework assignment). 
    - Each student can hand in only one homework late (within two days after the deadline). 
    - After attempting homework problems on an individual basis, students may discuss a homework assignment with their classmates. However, students must write up their own solutions individually and explicitly indicate from whom (if anyone) or resources students received help at the top of their homework solutions.
   
- Midterm examination 
  - In-class examination: \rc Wednesday, October 23, 2019 @ 1:30PM - 2.20 PM, Gates B3.\bc
  - Students **are not allowed** to take midterm examinations other than the scheduled date and time (except for the event of extraordinary circumstance that is determined solely by me.)
    
- Final examination
  - In-class examination.
  - Following the Stanford [calendar](https://registrar.stanford.edu/autumn-quarter-exams): \rc Wednesday, December 11, 2019 @ 3:30PM-6:30 PM, location TBD.\bc
  - Students **are not allowed** to take final examinations earlier than the scheduled date and time (except for the event of extraordinary circumstance that is determined solely by me.).
  - Students **are not allowed** to take this course with another conflicting final examination schedule. 
    
- Accessible Education
    - Students with Documented Disabilities: Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, [URL:https://oae.stanford.edu/](https://oae.stanford.edu/).)
    - Provide me an accommodation letter on or before **09/30/2019**.
    
- Honor Code
    - Students are bound by the [Stanford Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code). Violation of the honor code will result in a failing grade among other penalties.
    
- Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD)
  - Stats 191 is listed as one of the SCPD courses.
  - Lecture recordings are being made and might be shared with others at Stanford beyond those currently enrolled in the class.
  - SCPD policies on student privacy: __Video cameras located in the back of the room will capture the instructor presentations in this course. For your convenience, you can access these recordings by logging into the course Canvas site. These recordings might be reused in other Stanford courses, viewed by other Stanford students, faculty, or staff, or used for other education and research purposes. Note that while the cameras are positioned with the intention of recording only the instructor, occasionally a part of your image or voice might be incidentally captured. If you have questions, please contact a member of the teaching team.__
